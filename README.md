# Vulkan Appollonian Gasket
This project was a laboratory work for Discrete Mathematics. 
I used Vulkan just for fun to test my capabilities with it.
Everything is in a single file (besides the complex number class to allow for operator overloading), to make the development faster.

Da result is attached below. Each color represents one itteration.

Runs at around 700fps on my iGPU, although I don't use instancing.
